## Infinite Wordle

A place where you can keep playing Wordle until you get bored of it.

# How to play

You get 6 tries to guess a randomly generated word (only the top 30000 most popular words, nothing obscure), each guess has different feedbacks:

Green: The character is in the right spot
Yellow: The character exists in the word but is in the wrong spot
Gray: The character doesn't exist in the word

Based off of these feedbacks, use your big brain and try to guess the secret word.
Good luck and have fun!
